# DVD Renter Dataset
## Project overview
The DVD rental database is a sample database used for learning and practicing SQL. It includes tables for customers, films, 
rentals, payments, actors, and more. The schema provides a comprehensive set of data that simulates a real-world DVD rental business. Using PostgreSQL

### Objective
1.	Data Querying: Extract specific information from the database to answer business questions
2.	Data Cleaning: Identify and rectify any inaccuracies, inconsistencies, or incomplete data within the database.
   
### Files description
  •	Read.me: This file. Provides an overview and instructions for the project
  •	Queries/data_query.sql: Contains SQL scripts for querying data from the DVD rental database.
  •	Queries/data_cleaning.sql: Contains SQL scripts for cleaning the data.
  •	Output/Query_result.sql: Results of the data queries, exported as a CSV file:
  •	Output/Cleaned_data.sql: Cleaned data, exported as a CSV file

1.	### Instruction
    SETTING UP DATABASE
    Ensure you have the DVD rental database installed on your PostgreSQL server. Follow the instructions on the PostgreSQL website to download and restore the database if necessary.
  	
2.	### Running the Queries 
    #### Data Query
     1. Open your PostgreSQL client (e.g., pgAdmin, psql
     2.	Connect to the DVD rental database
     3.	Open and execute the SQL script located in queries/data_query.sql
     4.	Review the output of the queries. You can save the results as  query_result.sql
        
     #### Data Cleaning
      1.	Open your PostgreSQL client (e.g., pgAdmin, psql.
      2.	Connect to the DVD rental database
      3.	Open and execute the SQL script located in  Queries/data_cleaning.sql
      4.	Review the changes made to the data. You can save the cleaned data as clean_data.csv.
      5.	Review the changes made to the data. You can save the cleaned data as cleaned_data.csv
