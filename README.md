# Data Query and Data Cleaning in PostgreSQL Using DVD Rental 
## Project Overview:
This project focuses on querying and cleaning the DVD rental dataset using PostgreSQL. 
The primary aim is to ensure data integrity and prepare the dataset for advanced analysis and reporting.

## Objectives:
•	Clean and standardize the DVD rental dataset.

•	Perform complex SQL queries to extract valuable insights.

•	Ensure data integrity and consistency across the dataset.

## Data Source:

•	DVD rental dataset containing information on customers, rentals, inventory, and films.

## Key Features:

### 1.	Data Cleaning:
   
•	Identified and handled missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies.

•	Standardized data formats to ensure uniformity across the dataset.

### 2.	Data Transformation:

•	Used SQL functions to transform and aggregate data.

•	Created new calculated fields to support analysis.

### 3.	Data Querying:

•	Developed complex SQL queries to extract meaningful insights from the dataset.

•	Conducted joins, subqueries, and CTEs (Common Table Expressions) to analyze relationships between different tables.

### 4.	Data Integrity:
   
•	Ensured referential integrity and consistency across tables.

•	Validated data entries to maintain high data quality.

### 5.	Reporting:
   
•	Compiled query results into a structured format for reporting.

•	Provided insights and recommendations based on the query results.

Key SQL Techniques Used:

•	Data Cleaning: UPDATE, DELETE, CASE statements.

•	Data Transformation: CAST, COALESCE, string functions.

•	Joins: INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, FULL JOIN.

•	Subqueries and CTEs: Extracted and organized data efficiently.

•	Aggregations: SUM, AVG, COUNT, GROUP BY.
